      "Think this place is a bit underrated. Was here after a broadway show and we had New York strip steak and tilapia acqua pazza on the meal set menu. Good quality food with such good price! They also have live music after 6:30pm. Definitely a delightful dinner!.-- Amanda",
      "Had a lovely dinner with seven of us at the table.  The service was good and efficient. The food was excellent.They have a fixed price option for 39.50 and you get an app dinner and desert.  A good deal for NYC.  I would recommend for a pre theatre dinner..-- Tom",
      "It has some what a fancy feel to it, but its a small restaurant with a small menu.-- David"
